# Week 7

## Original exercise brief:

---

### Git

You should build a Git repository. In particular, you should do the following:
- Create a Git repository on your system.
- Add all of your previous exercises to this repository.
- Create and merge branches when developing your repository.  

---

So I think this is pretty obvious that this repository is actually a result of successful completion of the tasks described above.
