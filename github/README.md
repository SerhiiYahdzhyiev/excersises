# Week 5

## Original exercise brief:

---

#### GitHub

You should build your personal GitHub page. In particular, you should do the following:

- Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you have not done it yet.
- Create a [GitHub page](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_remote_pages.asp?remote=github) for yourself.
- Format the layout and fill in the content of the page to make it your portfolio.

For this exercise I've (temporarily) cloned my old CV website code to a new GitHub account and created a GitHub page from it.
I will later finish the development of the new, updated personal website and replace my old page with it.
