## Original exercise brief:

### LaTeX

You should build your professional CV using LaTeX. In particular, you should do the following:

- Create an account on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
- Choose a CV template from [Overleaf Gallery](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery).
- Adopt the LaTeX template on Overleaf to design and implement your CV.

You can find my latex cv in the `latex-cv-src` folder.
I've used [ModerCV](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/moderncv-cv-and-cover-letter) template for it.
