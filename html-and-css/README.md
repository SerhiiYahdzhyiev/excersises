## Original exercise brief:

### HTML and CSS

You should build your personal web page using HTML and CSS. In particular, you should do the following:

- Check [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) tutorials to familiarize yourself with different features of HTML and CSS.
- Create a simple static web page for your portfolio using HTML.
- Format the layout of the web page using CSS.

You can check my old portfolio website on [this link](https://sergeyyahdzhyiev.github.io/)

The source code is [here](https://github.com/SergeyYahdzhyiev/sergeyyahdzhyiev.github.io).

This website I did long time ago, so the source code might be not so "clean", but I'm currently working on the new one. I'll add the link here as soon as it's ready.
