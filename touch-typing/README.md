# Week 2

## Original exercise brief:

&ensp;### Touch Typing
&ensp;You should develop your touch typing skills through the term. In particular, you should do the following:
&ensp; - Do an online typing test with your default typing style using websites such as [TypingAcademy](https://www.typing.academy/typing-tutor/typing-test). Write down the results in the following table.
&ensp; - Start doing online touch typing exercises using websites such as [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/).
&ensp;- Keep doing the exercises and updating the following table until the end of the term. Present the table and discuss your progress in your final assignment.

&ensp;| Date | Words per Minute | Error Rate |
&ensp;|------|------------------|------------|
&ensp;| | | |
&ensp;| | | |
&ensp;| | | |
&ensp;| | | |
&ensp;| | | |

Unfortunately (for me) I haven't updated this table, but I had actually done touch typing practice daily
during the whole module period (and I am planning to continue).
